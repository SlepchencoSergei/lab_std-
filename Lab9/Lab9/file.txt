«Come,» said the Wind to the Leaves one day.
«Come over the meadow and we will play.
Put on your dresses of red and gold.
For summer is gone and the days grow cold.»
Autumn leaves
Leaves on the ground are turning,
Yellow, brown and red.
Smoke from the bonfire burning,
Climbing overhead.
Here comes Autumn to bring the mist and rain.
Summer has gone for another year,
Autumn's here again.
